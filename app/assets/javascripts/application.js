// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
//
// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives.

//= require rails-ujs
//= require activestorage
//= require turbolinks
//= require_tree .

// Bootstrap tooltips and popovers depend on popper.js for positioning.
// The bootstrap gem already depends on the popper_js gem.
// Add Bootstrap dependencies and Bootstrap to your application.js:
//= require jquery3
//= require popper
//= require bootstrap-sprockets

// While bootstrap-sprockets provides individual Bootstrap components for ease of debugging,
// you may alternatively require the concatenated bootstrap for faster compilation:
// = r e q u i r e jquery3
// = r e q u i r e popper
// = r e q u i r e bootstrap
