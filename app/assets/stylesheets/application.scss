/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Then, remove all the *= require and *= require_tree statements from the Sass file. Instead,
 * use @import to import Sass files.
 *
 * Do not use *= require in Sass or your other stylesheets will not be able to access the
 * Bootstrap mixins and variables.

// Custom bootstrap variables must be set or imported *before* bootstrap.
@import "bootstrap";

/*
 * Configuration
 * Sass: Autoprefixer
 * Bootstrap requires the use of Autoprefixer.
 * Autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from Can I Use.
 *
 * If you are using bootstrap with Rails, autoprefixer is set up for you automatically.
 * Otherwise, please consult the Autoprefixer documentation.
 *
 * Sass: Individual components
 * By default all of Bootstrap is imported.
 *
 * You can also import components explicitly. To start with a full list of modules
 * copy _bootstrap.scss file into your assets as _bootstrap-custom.scss. Then
 * comment out components you do not want from _bootstrap-custom. In the application Sass file,
 * replace @import 'bootstrap' with:
 *
 * @import 'bootstrap-custom';
